Example Code for Admin Sessions could iclude code such as this: 

Admin Sessions:

Start: The beginning of the admin session.

session_start(); // Initiating a session
Admin Login:
Admins log in to access the admin panel.
Upon successful authentication, an admin session is created, indicating that they are logged in as an admin.
An error is displayed if they are not an active admin or if they enter the wrong information.


if (adminIsAuthenticated()) {
    // Successful login, create admin session
    $_SESSION['admin_id'] = $admin_id; // Storing admin ID in the session
} else {
    // Display error message
}
Admin Actions:
The admin session allows them to perform admin-specific actions in the admin panel.


if (isset($_SESSION['admin_id'])) {
    // Admin actions allowed
} else {
    // Redirect or show an error for unauthorized access
}
Access Plants Database:
The admin accesses the plants database, which includes information about plants available for purchase.
This includes plant names, types, prices, and stock quantities.
Each plant is represented as a record in the Plants table.


Copy code
if (isset($_SESSION['admin_id'])) {
    // Access the database to retrieve plant information
} else {
    // Show error for unauthorized access
}
Save Changes:
The changes made by the admin are saved, and the database is updated.


if (isset($_SESSION['admin_id'])) {
    // Save changes to the database
} else {
    // Show error for unauthorized access
}
Admin Logout:
When the admin logs out or the session expires, the admin session data is cleared, and they are no longer considered logged in as an admin.


if (isset($_SESSION['admin_id'])) {
    // Log out and clear admin session
    session_unset();
    session_destroy();
}
End: Indicates the end of the admin session.

The same process for a Customer Session could look like: 

Customer Sessions:

Start: The beginning of the customer session when a customer visits the website.


session_start(); // Initiating a session
Initiate Session:
A session is initiated for the customer.


session_start(); // Initiating a customer session
Shopping Cart:
This session is used to store the contents of the customer's shopping cart as they browse and add items.


if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) {
    $_SESSION['cart'] = array(); // Initialize an empty cart
}
Add Items to Cart:
For each item added to the cart, the plant's details are stored in the session.
This includes plant name, type, price, and desired purchase quantity.


$product = array(
    'name' => 'Plant Name',
    'type' => 'Plant Type',
    'price' => 19.99,
    'quantity' => 1
);

array_push($_SESSION['cart'], $product); // Add the product to the cart
Stock Availability:
If the item is out of stock, the cart shows this information and does not allow the customer to purchase it.


if ($product['quantity'] <= 0) {
    // Show out-of-stock message
}
End: Indicates the end of the customer session.
